# go-timertxt

A Go library for working with timer.txt files.

A timer.txt file is a plain text file for timekeeping purposes. It stems from the same motivations as todo.txt (http://todotxt.org/).

This library is very similar to https://github.com/br0xen/go-todotxt, which is a fork of https://github.com/JamesClonk/go-todotxt.
